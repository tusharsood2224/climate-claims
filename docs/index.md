# Evaluation 

In “No, CNN, Wildfires Will Not Be Destroying Times Square, New York City” by James Taylor, the author argues that global warming does not cause wildfires. Specifically, Taylor argues that because wildfires have substantially declined as temperatures modestly warmed, it is incorrect to use the fewer wildfires that still occur to support the claim that global warming is causing them. This argument is of particular interest because it goes against what is widely accepted. Despite it being common knowledge that climate change leads to more damaging and unpredictable weather events such as wildfires, this argument completely refutes this; that said, it simultaneously accepts that the Earth is warming up, referencing data from NASA. 

The article was published on October 18, 2021 on the well-known climate-skeptic website “Watts Up With That?”, self-proclaimed as “[t]he world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change” (Taylor, 2021). It was reposted from “Climate Realism”, a project of the Heartland Institute, and written by James Taylor, the president of the same organization (ClimateRealism, 2021). This conservative, libertarian think tank promotes free-market solutions to societal problems (The Heartland Institute, 2021). Even though the often-criticized institute claims to be non-partisan, it lists “Stopping Socialism” among its top issues.  This organization, historically backed by the fossil fuel industry, is well-known for supporting debate on climate science (Worth, 2018). They have also denied other science in the past, including that which identified the risks of cigarette smoking, presumably to appease the cigarette companies supporting the institute (Surgey, 2014). 

This source is inaccurate and misleading. For example, it claims “wildfires have not engulfed New York City any time since SUVs were invented, nor will wildfires ever engulf New York City” (Taylor, 2021). However, despite SUVs being around since at least 1940 (Palombi, 2017), New York City’s wetlands continue to regularly experience fires (NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, 2021). The article also says that “[a]ccording to NASA, lands burned by wildfires have decreased by 24 percent since the satellite measurements first began” (Taylor, 2021). However, the 2017 NASA source Taylor referenced states that this drop includes fires of both natural and human-driven causes (NASA Earth Observatory, 2017). In fact, this same source indicates that climate change has actually increased fire risk in many regions, but that fewer fires are directly caused by humans (i.e., agricultural clearing). 

The article also lacks logical validity. For example, even if it were true that wildfires have not happened in New York City since SUVs were made, it does not mean that they will never happen. It is also disingenuous to state that future wildfires “would almost certainly have been started by arsonists than climate change” (Taylor, 2021), as this claim is both unsupported and speculative. The article’s bias, evident through the use of descriptors such as “media sock puppets” (Taylor, 2021), damages its credibility. To add, it is incorrect to assume causation after simply correlating two variables; there may be other factors at play. Considering all of this, is the argument even plausible? The fact that the number of wildfires is decreasing would be, in itself, plausible if supported by credible sources. If a reduction were documented, however, the notion that wildfires are not caused by climate change would still be a far fetch. Current evidence indicates that climate change increases the risk of wildfires (Jones, et al., 2020). Climate change facilitates the conditions necessary for these events (Xu, et al., 2020) and can even result in forests being less resilient to recovery post-fire (Stevens-Rumann, et al., 2018). Thus, this claim is found to be invalid and supported by poorly-constructed arguments.
